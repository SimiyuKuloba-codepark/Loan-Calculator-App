# Loan-Calculator-App

The App does simple calculations on loan payments. The user inputs the amount of money they need for loan, the rate of interest and the duration they intend to pay the loan. 

When they click the calculate button, the App gives them the total amount of money they'll have to pay with also a breakdown on how much they'll have to pay each month plus the interest amount.

The Application is built on HTML, pure CSS without frameworks and Vanilla JavaScript.

Its a Simple Awesome App
